# **Azure ML Iris Flower Classification**

**Description:**

This project leverages Azure Machine Learning to build and deploy a machine learning model for classifying flower species based on the Iris dataset. 
It utilizes Python and the Azure ML SDK for training, deployment, and web app integration. This was part of hand-on-training of the AIDI-2004 program

**Key Features:**

* Machine Learning Model: Trains a model (classifier1.pkl) using Azure ML to predict flower types based on sepal and petal measurements (features in the Iris dataset).
* Deployment: Deploys the trained model as a web service on Azure.
* Web App Integration: Integrates the deployed model into a web application.

**Prerequisites:**

* Azure subscription (free tier available)
* Basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MOAZ47/Azure-ML-Iris-Flower-Classification.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Azure Credentials:**
   - Follow the Azure ML documentation to set up your Azure environment and obtain necessary credentials.

**Usage:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the application (replace with appropriate command if different):**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
